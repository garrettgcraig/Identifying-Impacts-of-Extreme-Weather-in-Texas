## INSERT README SCREENSHOT HERE

## Overview
 
In February 2021, the state of Texas experienced unprecedented winter storms that caused widespread power outages across the state. This analysis uses remotely-sensed night lights data to estimate the number of homes in Houston that lost power during these storms. By combining satellite data from NASA's Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), building footprint data from OpenStreetMap, and socioeconomic data from the US Census Bureau, we can identify which areas were affected and explore potential disparities in infrastructure impacts.

## Data Sources

- **VIIRS Night Lights Data**: Daily satellite imagery showing nighttime light intensity (4 tiles covering Houston area)
  - Pre-storm: February 7, 2021
  - During storm: February 16, 2021
- **OpenStreetMap (OSM)**: Geospatial data on buildings and roads in Houston
- **US Census Bureau**: American Community Survey (ACS) 2019 5-year estimates at the census tract level

## Setup

```{r setup}
# Load required libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(stars)
library(tmap)
library(patchwork)
library(ggspatial)

# Set options
options(scipen = 999)
```

## Load and Process Night Lights Data

### Read and Combine VIIRS Tiles

```{r load-viirs}
# Load night lights data for February 7, 2021 (pre-storm)
# First unzip the data if not already unzipped
if (!dir.exists("data/VNP46A1")) {
  unzip("data/VNP46A1.zip", exdir = "data")
}

# List all the tiles for Feb 7 (day 038) and Feb 16 (day 047)
# Note: files are in nested VNP46A1/VNP46A1/ directory
tiles_feb07 <- list.files("data/VNP46A1/VNP46A1",
                          pattern = "VNP46A1\\.A2021038\\.h08v0[56]\\.001.*\\.tif$",

# Combine tiles for each date using st_mosaic

### Create Blackout Mask

```{r blackout-mask}
# Calculate difference in light intensity between the two dates
light_diff <- feb07_lights - feb16_lights

# Reclassify: identify areas with light drops > 200 nW cm^-2 sr^-1
# Areas with drops > 200 are considered blackouts (value = 1)
# All other areas get NA
blackout_mask <- light_diff > 200
blackout_mask[blackout_mask == FALSE] <- NA

# Vectorize the raster
blackout_vector <- st_as_sf(blackout_mask)

# Fix invalid geometries
blackout_vector <- st_make_valid(blackout_vector)

# Define Houston bounding box coordinates
houston_coords <- matrix(c(-96.5, 29,
                          -96.5, 30.5,
                          -94.5, 30.5,

# Create polygon and convert to sf object
# First create polygon, then convert to sfc, then to sf with CRS
houston_polygon <- st_polygon(list(houston_coords))
houston_sf <- st_sfc(houston_polygon, crs = st_crs(blackout_vector))

# Crop blackout mask to Houston area
blackout_houston <- st_intersection(blackout_vector, houston_sf)

# Reproject to EPSG:3083 (NAD83 / Texas Centric Albers Equal Area)
blackout_houston <- st_transform(blackout_houston, crs = 3083)

## Discussion

This analysis estimated the impact of the February 2021 Texas winter storms on Houston residential power outages using remotely-sensed night lights data. The results reveal substantial power disruptions across the metropolitan area, with tens of thousands of residential buildings experiencing blackouts. The socioeconomic analysis provides insight into whether certain communities were disproportionately affected based on median household income. By combining satellite observations with geospatial data on infrastructure and demographics, this study demonstrates the utility of remote sensing for rapid disaster impact assessment and highlights potential environmental justice concerns that warrant further investigation.

### Key Findings

- Significant power outages were detected across Houston during the February 2021 winter storms
- The analysis identified specific residential areas that experienced blackouts after excluding highway-adjacent areas
- Census tract-level analysis reveals patterns in which communities were affected by power outages

### Limitations

- Night lights data may not perfectly correlate with power outages (e.g., commercial areas vs. residential)
- Highway exclusion buffer (200m) is somewhat arbitrary
- Census tract-level analysis may mask within-tract variation
- Temporal mismatch between 2019 ACS data and 2021 storm event
- Building classification in OSM may be incomplete or inaccurate
